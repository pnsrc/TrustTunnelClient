## Usage

> Windows specific: For tunnel listener to work, `wintun.dll` must be in the DLL search path. Basically, you could [download it](https://www.wintun.net/), extract the file (from the folder matching your architecture, like `amd64`) and place it into the same directory as `trusttunnel_client` executable.

To run the TrustTunnel CLI Client, execute the following command:

```shell
./trusttunnel_client --config <path/to/configuration/file.toml>
```

Replace `<path/to/configuration/file.toml>` with the actual path to your configuration file.
You may need to run the command with superuser privileges if a TUN device is selected.
