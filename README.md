# AdGuard VPN Libraries

[![AdGuardVPN.com](https://img.shields.io/badge/AdGuardVPN.com-Visit-007BFF)](https://adguard-vpn.com/)

AdGuard VPN Libraries is a collection of C++ libraries that provide client network traffic
tunneling through an AdGuard VPN endpoint.
It supports Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Features

- **AdGuard VPN Protocol**: The library implements the AdGuard VPN protocol, which is compatible
  with HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and QUIC.
  By mimicking regular network traffic, it becomes more difficult for government regulators to
  detect and block.

- **Traffic Tunneling**: The library is capable of tunneling TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic from the
  client to the endpoint and back.

- **Cross-Platform Support**: It supports Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, providing a
  consistent experience across different operating systems.

- **System-Wide Tunnel and SOCKS5 Proxy**: It can be set up as a system-wide tunnel, utilizing a
  virtual network interface, as well as a SOCKS5 proxy.

- **Split Tunneling**: The library supports split tunneling, allowing users to exclude connections
  to certain domains or hosts from routing through the VPN endpoint, or vice versa, only routing
  connections to specific domains or hosts through the endpoint based on an exclusion list.

- **Custom DNS Upstream**: Users can specify a custom DNS upstream, which is used for DNS queries
  routed through the VPN endpoint.

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 3.18 or higher
- [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/) 14 or higher
- [Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/releases) 1.51 up to 1.60
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.66 or higher
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.18.3 or higher
- Windows-specific
    - A recent version of Perl,
      either [Active State Perl](https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/)
      or [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/).
      But the latter one adds GCC to `PATH`, which can confuse some build tools when identifying
      the compiler (removing `C:\Strawberry\c\bin` from `PATH` should resolve any problems).
    - [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/)
    - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/) 2019

### Building

#### Using Makefile

This command builds and exports required binaries to the `bin` directory:

```shell
EXPORT_DIR=bin make build_and_export_standalone_client
```

`EXPORT_DIR=bin` can be omitted. `bin` is the default value for `EXPORT_DIR`.
You can change the output directory path by specifying other value.

#### Manually

If it's a clean build, export custom Conan packages to the local Conan repository.
Refer to the [details here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/NativeLibsCommon/blob/master/README.md),
or run the helper script:

```shell
./scripts/bootstrap_conan_deps.py conandata.yml \
  https://github.com/AdguardTeam/NativeLibsCommon.git \
  https://github.com/AdguardTeam/DnsLibs.git
```

To build the main library:

* Windows:

    ```shell
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ^
      -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG=/MT ^
      -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG=/MT ^
      -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
      ..
    cmake --build . --target vpnlibs_core
    ```

* Others:

    ```shell
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=ReleaseWithDebInfo \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="clang" \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="clang++" \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-stdlib=libc++" \
      ..
    cmake --build . --target vpnlibs_core
    ```

To run tests:

```shell
cmake --build . --target tests && ctest
```

To build the standalone client application, run:

```shell
cmake --build . --target standalone_client
```

To build the setup wizard tool, run:

```shell
cmake --build . --target setup_wizard
```

For more information, refer to the [client's README](./standalone_client/README.md) file.

## Quick Start the Standalone VPN Client

To quickly configure and launch the VPN client, follow these steps:

1. [Build](#building) the wizard and client libraries.

2. Generate the minimal working configuration file using the setup wizard tool:

   ```shell
   ./setup_wizard --mode non-interactive \
     --address "127.0.0.1:443" --address "[::]:443" \
     --hostname example.org \
     --creds premium:premium \
     --cert cert.pem \
     --settings standalone_client.toml
   ```

   This results in the following configuration:

    * The endpoint is expected to listen to the port number 443 on the local host.
    * `example.com` is used as the hostname during TLS handshakes.
    * `premium` and `premium` are used as the username and password correspondingly.
    * `cert.pem` certificate is used to verify endpoint's TLS certificate during the handshake.
      It can be obtained after the [endpoint](#companion-endpoint-repository) setup procedure.
    * Implicitly, the outbound traffic listener method is set to the TUN device.
    * The configuration file is named `standalone_client.toml`.

3. Start the client:

   ```shell
   # sudo is required because TUN device is used by default
   sudo ./standalone_client --config standalone_client.toml
   ```

For detailed explanations, see the [client README](./standalone_client/README.md).

## Testing Changes as a Conan Dependency

To test local changes in the library when used as a Conan package dependency, follow these steps:

1. Create patch files by executing `git diff > 1.patch` in the project root.

2. Add the paths to the patch files in `<root>/conanfile.py` using the `patch_files` field.

3. If the default `vcs_url` field in `<root>/conanfile.py` is not suitable, change it accordingly.

4. Export the Conan package with a special version number, for example:

   ```shell
   conan export . /777@AdguardTeam/NativeLibsCommon
   ```

5. In the project that uses `vpn-libs` as a dependency, change the version to `777`.
   For example, `vpn-libs/1.0.0@AdguardTeam/NativeLibsCommon` ->
   `vpn-libs/777@AdguardTeam/NativeLibsCommon`.

6. Re-run the CMake command.

> Notes:
>
> - If you have already exported `vpn-libs` in this manner, you must purge the cached version
    using `conan remove -f vpn-libs/777`.
> - By default, patches are applied to the `master` branch. Specify the `commit_hash` option to
    test changes against a specific commit.

## Companion Endpoint Repository

Complementary endpoint implementation for the AdGuard VPN Libraries can be found in
the [AdGuard VPN Endpoint repository](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/VpnEndpoint).

---

## Roadmap

While the library currently does not support peer-to-peer communication between clients, we have
plans to add this feature in future releases. Stay tuned for updates.
