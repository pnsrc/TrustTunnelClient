/**
 * Locations pinger is intended to help to select an optimal endpoint for a location.
 * To achieve this it does the following:
 *     1) measures round-trip time for each endpoint in a location
 *     2) selects a suitable endpoint from the successfully pinged ones using
 *        the following criteria:
 *             a) IPv6 addresses prevail over IPv4 ones
 *             b) An address specified earlier in the list prevails over the latter ones
 *        - note, that low RTT value does not make endpoint to be selected
