# CHANGELOG

* [Feature] The library now notify an application with information about connection. This event contain info
about source ip, destination (ip, domain or both), transport protocol and action (bypass/tunnel).
For this purpose, new event `VPN_EVENT_CONNECTION_INFO` was introduced in `VpnEvent`.

## 0.92.115

* Added a new `VpnConnectAction`: `VPN_CA_REJECT`. 

## 0.92.107

* Added `VpnConnectedInfo::relay_address`.

## 0.92.100

* Added `VpnEndpoint::remote_id`. See the field's doc for details.

## 0.92.94

* Changes in pinging behaviour.
    * See the updated doc comments for the fields of `LocationsPingerInfo` and `PingInfo`, `locations_pinger_start`, `ping_start` for details.
    * The pinging timeout is now per connection attempt, NOT for the whole pinging procedure. Applications may need to adjust.

## 0.92.90

* Changes in pinging and locations API.
    * Removed `VpnUpstreamConfig::relay_addresses` and `LocationsPingerInfo::relay_address`.
    * Added `VpnLocation::relay_addresses`.
    * When a `VpnLocation` is used as part of a `VpnUpstreamConfig`, its relay addresses shall be used
      exactly in the same manner as `VpnUpstreamConfig::relay_addresses` were used before.
    * The documentation for `ag::locations_pinger_start` has been updated to include a note about how
      the location's relay addresses are used by the pinger.

## 0.92.88

* [Feature] Support connecting to endpoints through a set of SNI proxies.
    * `VpnUpstreamConfig::relay_addresses` can now be specified when connecting to a location.
      The client shall try using one of the relay addresses to connect to an endpoint if it's unavailable
      on its normal address. The client shall automatically disqualify relay addresses that don't work.
    * `LocationsPingerInfo::relay_address` can now be specified when pinging a location. The pinger shall try
      to use it if an endpoint is unavailable on its normal address. `PingResult::through_relay` will be
      non-zero if the relay is used. The application should try pinging with a different relay address if
      there are pinging errors through the relay.
    * `LocationsPinger` will now send ClientHello/QUIC Initial to "ping" the endpoints.
    * `LocationsPinger::anti_dpi` can now be specified to enable or disable anti-DPI measures during pinging.

## 0.92.74

* [Feature] The library now notifies an application about the amount of traffic passed through
  connections that have been routed through an endpoint.
  For this purpose, two events were introduced in `VpnEvent`:
  * `VPN_EVENT_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_STATS` - raised only for connections that have been routed through
    an endpoint,
  * `VPN_EVENT_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_CLOSED` - raised for any user connection.

## 0.92.46

* [Feature] The library now accepts CIDR range in exclusion list.

## 0.92.28

* Removed `vpn_network_manager_update_tun_interface_dns()` as redundant.

## 0.92.23

* The library now accepts a list of DNS upstreams instead of a single one.
  * `dns_upsteam` field of `VpnListenerConfig` renamed to `dns_upsteams`.
  * `dns_upsteam` field removed from `VpnDnsUpstreamUnavailableEvent`.

## 0.92.11

* [Feature] `h3://` scheme is now allowed for DNS upstream.

## 0.91.88

* DNS queries are now routed according to VPN settings. I.e., queries with domains
  matching exclusions are routed directly to the target resolver in the general mode,
  but queries not matching exclusions are routed through the endpoint. To do it correctly
  the library needs to know the system (see `dns_manager_set_tunnel_interface_servers()`)
  and TUN interface DNS servers (see `vpn_network_manager_update_tun_interface_dns()`).
* The library now has one centralized point for setting the outbound network
  interface for I/O operations - `vpn_network_manager_set_outbound_interface()`.
  * [Windows] Use the method above instead of the removed `vpn_win_set_bound_if()`.

## 0.91.82

* [Fix] Introduced an error code indicating that no connection attempts left
  after initial connect() call `VPN_EC_INITIAL_CONNECT_FAILED`.

## 0.91.45

* [Changed] `Location unavailable` semantics:
  * It is now considered as a fatal error, i.e. the client goes in the disconnected state.
    It is up to application to refresh a location data and restart the client.
  * It is now raised only after the client receives the abandon command.
    It is up to application to detect infinite recovery loop in case there are some
    connectivity issues.
* [Changed] [Windows] `vpn_abandon_endpoint()` now takes an endpoint as a parameter

## 0.91.20

* [Changed] [Windows] Calling `vpn_win_set_bound_if()` now turns off the socket protection instead of
  detecting an active network interface by itself. It's up to the application to call the new method
  `vpn_win_detect_active_if()` and pass its result to `vpn_win_set_bound_if()` to activate the socket
  protection.

## 0.91.10

* [Feature] Added Wintun support. Dll downloaded from www.wintun.net is needed for standalone_client to run under Windows.

## 0.90.15

* [Feature] Route QUIC connections according to the VPN mode instead of always dropping or redirecting them

## 0.90.13

* [Fix] Fix leaks and memory bugs in `tls_serialize_cert_chain`, `tls_free_serialized_chain`. Add tests.

## 0.90.12

* [Fix] Change signature of some exported functions to be more consistent with the rest and simpler for C# bindings.

## 0.90.6

* [Fix] Fix version increment script.

## 0.90.4

* [Feature] VpnLibs is now open-source.
