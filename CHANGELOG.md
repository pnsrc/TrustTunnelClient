## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [1.1.5-beta.4] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- File logging and logs exporting for apple and android platform adapters. See `VpnManager.exportLogs()` and `VpnService.exportLogs`.

## [1.1.5-beta.3] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- An alternative route for DNS queries for excluded domains, selected with `VpnListenerConfig::dns_alt_exclusions_route`.

## [1.1.5-beta.2] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Add logging callback APIs for Android and Apple adapters to let applications override native log output handling.
- Add Apple `NativeLogger` API in `VpnClientFramework` and expose callback forwarding in `TrustTunnelClient.Logger`.

### Changed

- Route `TrustTunnelClient` internal logger messages through the same optional callback path before defaulting to system logs.
- Include logger names in adapter callback messages and route Android/Apple adapter-side logs through the same callback-aware logger path.
- Updated dns-libs to 2.8.54

## [1.1.5-beta.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Add new settings to `VpnSettings` for controlling site exclusion behavior:
    - `exclusions_tcp_early_ack_enabled` (default: `false`): when enabled, all TCP connections to scannable
      ports are initially routed through a fake upstream to read the TLS SNI before making any real connection.
      This ensures site exclusions work correctly when a secure DNS resolver is configured outside of
      AdGuard VPN or when the exclusion list contains wildcard entries (e.g. `*.example.com`).
    - `exclusions_preresolve_enabled` (default: `true`): controls whether DNS-resolvable exclusions are
      pre-resolved in the background after the exclusion list is updated.
    - `exclusions_preresolve_max_queries` (default: `50`): limits the number of domains pre-resolved.
      Setting this to `0` uses the default value.
    Default values for all three settings are available via `vpn_get_default_settings()`.

### Changed

- `trusttunnel_client` config now supports `exclusions_tcp_early_ack_enabled`,
  `exclusions_preresolve_enabled`, and `exclusions_preresolve_max_queries` as top-level keys in
  `trusttunnel_client.toml`; absent values fall back to the defaults from `vpn_get_default_settings()`.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Linux C API wrappers vpn_linux_tunnel_create and vpn_linux_tunnel_destroy

### Changed

- Opt-in Linux package build mode for exporting WIN_EXPORT symbols in C API builds without affecting default Linux builds

## [1.1.3] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Added C++ ring buffer implementation for use in Flutter Client

### Changed

- Improved network change detection under Linux

### Fixed

- Fixed link-local IPv6 system DNS server detection under macOS

## [1.0.63] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Add `tcp_recv_buf_size` and `tcp_send_buf_size` options to `[listener.tun]` section.
            These allow tuning TCP window and send buffer sizes per connection.
            Default (0) uses optimized compile-time values (256 KB each). Adjust only for
            constrained environments or specific network conditions.
- Add periodic heap trimming to reduce RSS after traffic bursts.
            Frees fragmented heap pages back to the OS, preventing memory growth over long sessions.

## [1.0.62] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Improve control over TUN device configuration.
    - Add `device_name` field that controls the TUN interface name on Linux, the requested `utun<N>` unit on macOS,
      and the Wintun adapter name on Windows.
    - Add `use_existing` boolean field that allows opening an existing TUN device specified by `device_name`. Linux only.
    - Correctly handle `included_routes = []` and skip route/rule setup and cleanup in this case
      (except DNS routes controlled by `change_system_dns`).
    - Remove the Windows-specific `adapter_name` configuration field; Windows adapter naming is now configured via
      `device_name`.

## [1.0.56] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Add wildcard port syntax (`*:port`) to `VpnSettings::exclusions`.
            Any connection to the specified port is matched regardless of the destination address.

## [1.0.49] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Protect service socket for DNS query forwarding with securely generated password #62

## [1.0.45] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Support importing DNS upstreams and server name from deep-link.
            The `dns_upstreams` field is moved to `[endpoint]` section.
            For backward compatibility, `dns_upstreams` in the root config section is still supported for old configs.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Added support for updated `tt://?` deep-link format.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Support [deep-link](https://github.com/TrustTunnel/TrustTunnel/blob/master/DEEP_LINK.md) config import.
    - Add `--deeplink` flag to setup_wizard non-interactive mode.
    - Add an interactive menu option to import config from a deep-link.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Support hostnames in endpoint addresses. Hostnames are resolved via DNS at connect time,
            producing multiple endpoints for each resolved IP address.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- Add `custom_sni` field to the endpoint configuration.
  This allows specifying the TLS SNI value separately from the hostname, replacing the
  pipe (`|`) syntax in the `hostname` field. The old syntax is still supported for backward compatibility,
  but using both simultaneously is now an error.

## [0.99.118] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Add a new error code, `VPN_EC_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_FAILED`, indicating that an endpoint's certificate
            could not be verified. This is a recoverable error which may be handled by re-requesting information from
            the backend and reconnecting, similar to codes `VPN_EC_AUTH_REQUIRED` and `VPN_EC_LOCATION_UNAVAILABLE`.

## [0.99.108] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed segfault when running on FreshTomato-RT-AC66U MIPS firmware

## [0.99.104] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- Add GPG signing for TrustTunnel executables.

## [0.99.102] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- Add functions to get default VPN settings and free allocated resources.
    - See `vpn_get_default_settings` and `vpn_free_default_settings`.

### Changed

- Post-quantum cryptography is now enabled by default

## [0.99.96] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- [Windows] Fixed certificate validation failing with `WCRYPT_E_POLICY_STATUS` error.

## [0.99.93] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- Fixed setup_wizard architecture in Linux builds #5

## [0.99.92] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- Added prebuilt trusttunnel_client binaries for Windows

## [0.99.63] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- Add option to allow inbound connections to the specified UDP/TCP ports when
  `ag::VpnWinTunnelSettings::block_untunneled` is enabled.
    - See `ag::VpnWinTunnelSettings::block_untunneled_exclude_ports`.

## [0.95.31] - 2025-06-27

### Added

- IPv6 support must now be explicitly specified on each `VpnEndpoint`. Previously, the library assumed
  that all endpoints in a location have IPv6 support if any of the endpoints in a location had an IPv6 address.
    - See `VpnEndpoint::has_ipv6`.

## [0.94.7] - 2024-12-24

### Added

- Add an option to use a post-quantum group for key exchange in TLS handshakes.
    - See `vpn_post_quantum_group_set_enabled`.

## [0.93.28] - 2024-09-24

### Changed

- Handler profiling is now disabled by default.

## [0.93.18] - 2024-09-17

### Added

- Add an option to profile VPN handler execution: if enabled, a warning will be written to the log
  whenever a handler call is taking too long. Profiling is enabled by default. Applications might want to disable
  it when running in production.
    - See `ag::vpn_handler_profiling_set_enabled`.

## [0.92.182] - 2024-02-19

### Added

- The library now notify an application with information about connection. This event contain info
about source ip, destination (ip, domain or both), transport protocol and action (bypass/tunnel).
For this purpose, new event `VPN_EVENT_CONNECTION_INFO` was introduced in `VpnEvent`.

## [0.92.115] - 2023-10-03

### Changed

- Added a new `VpnConnectAction`: `VPN_CA_REJECT`.

## [0.92.107] - 2023-09-22

### Changed

- Added `VpnConnectedInfo::relay_address`.

## [0.92.100] - 2023-09-19

### Changed

- Added `VpnEndpoint::remote_id`. See the field's doc for details.

## [0.92.94] - 2023-09-13

### Changed

- Changes in pinging behaviour.
    - See the updated doc comments for the fields of `LocationsPingerInfo` and `PingInfo`, `locations_pinger_start`, `ping_start` for details.
    - The pinging timeout is now per connection attempt, NOT for the whole pinging procedure. Applications may need to adjust.

## [0.92.90] - 2023-09-08

### Changed

- Changes in pinging and locations API.
    - Removed `VpnUpstreamConfig::relay_addresses` and `LocationsPingerInfo::relay_address`.
    - Added `VpnLocation::relay_addresses`.
    - When a `VpnLocation` is used as part of a `VpnUpstreamConfig`, its relay addresses shall be used
      exactly in the same manner as `VpnUpstreamConfig::relay_addresses` were used before.
    - The documentation for `ag::locations_pinger_start` has been updated to include a note about how
      the location's relay addresses are used by the pinger.

## [0.92.88] - 2023-09-06

### Added

- Support connecting to endpoints through a set of SNI proxies.
    - `VpnUpstreamConfig::relay_addresses` can now be specified when connecting to a location.
      The client shall try using one of the relay addresses to connect to an endpoint if it's unavailable
      on its normal address. The client shall automatically disqualify relay addresses that don't work.
    - `LocationsPingerInfo::relay_address` can now be specified when pinging a location. The pinger shall try
      to use it if an endpoint is unavailable on its normal address. `PingResult::through_relay` will be
      non-zero if the relay is used. The application should try pinging with a different relay address if
      there are pinging errors through the relay.
    - `LocationsPinger` will now send ClientHello/QUIC Initial to "ping" the endpoints.
    - `LocationsPinger::anti_dpi` can now be specified to enable or disable anti-DPI measures during pinging.

## [0.92.74] - 2023-08-14

### Added

- The library now notifies an application about the amount of traffic passed through
  connections that have been routed through an endpoint.
  For this purpose, two events were introduced in `VpnEvent`:
    - `VPN_EVENT_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_STATS` - raised only for connections that have been routed through
    an endpoint,
    - `VPN_EVENT_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_CLOSED` - raised for any user connection.

## [0.92.46] - 2023-06-20

### Added

- The library now accepts CIDR range in exclusion list.

## [0.92.28] - 2023-04-19

### Changed

- Removed `vpn_network_manager_update_tun_interface_dns()` as redundant.

## [0.92.23] - 2023-04-07

### Changed

- The library now accepts a list of DNS upstreams instead of a single one.
    - `dns_upsteam` field of `VpnListenerConfig` renamed to `dns_upsteams`.
    - `dns_upsteam` field removed from `VpnDnsUpstreamUnavailableEvent`.

## [0.92.11] - 2023-03-07

### Added

- `h3://` scheme is now allowed for DNS upstream.

## [0.91.88] - 2023-02-14

### Changed

- DNS queries are now routed according to VPN settings. I.e., queries with domains
  matching exclusions are routed directly to the target resolver in the general mode,
  but queries not matching exclusions are routed through the endpoint. To do it correctly
  the library needs to know the system (see `dns_manager_set_tunnel_interface_servers()`)
  and TUN interface DNS servers (see `vpn_network_manager_update_tun_interface_dns()`).
- The library now has one centralized point for setting the outbound network
  interface for I/O operations - `vpn_network_manager_set_outbound_interface()`.
    - [Windows] Use the method above instead of the removed `vpn_win_set_bound_if()`.

## [0.91.82] - 2023-01-19

### Fixed

- Introduced an error code indicating that no connection attempts left
  after initial connect() call `VPN_EC_INITIAL_CONNECT_FAILED`.

## [0.91.45] - 2022-11-09

### Changed

- `Location unavailable` semantics:
    - It is now considered as a fatal error, i.e. the client goes in the disconnected state.
    It is up to application to refresh a location data and restart the client.
    - It is now raised only after the client receives the abandon command.
    It is up to application to detect infinite recovery loop in case there are some
    connectivity issues.
- [Windows] `vpn_abandon_endpoint()` now takes an endpoint as a parameter

## [0.91.20] - 2022-10-18

### Changed

- [Windows] Calling `vpn_win_set_bound_if()` now turns off the socket protection instead of
  detecting an active network interface by itself. It's up to the application to call the new method
  `vpn_win_detect_active_if()` and pass its result to `vpn_win_set_bound_if()` to activate the socket
  protection.

## [0.91.10] - 2022-10-07

### Added

- Added Wintun support. Dll downloaded from www.wintun.net is needed for standalone_client to run under Windows.

## [0.90.15] - 2022-08-17

### Added

- Route QUIC connections according to the VPN mode instead of always dropping or redirecting them

## [0.90.13] - 2022-08-05

### Fixed

- Fix leaks and memory bugs in `tls_serialize_cert_chain`, `tls_free_serialized_chain`. Add tests.

## [0.90.12] - 2022-08-04

### Fixed

- Change signature of some exported functions to be more consistent with the rest and simpler for C# bindings.

## [0.90.6] - 2022-08-03

### Fixed

- Fix version increment script.

## [0.90.4] - 2022-08-02

### Added

- VpnLibs is now open-source.
